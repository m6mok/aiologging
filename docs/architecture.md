# Architecture

aiologging mirrors the standard `logging` module — same names,
signatures, hierarchy and semantics — with the logging methods being
coroutines. The core design decision: **record creation is synchronous
at the call site, handler I/O is asynchronous in a background task**.

## The record path

```
await logger.info("msg %s", x)
  │ sync, at the call site:
  │   level check → rate limit → findCaller → makeRecord
  │   (so caller info, %-formatting, exc_info behave exactly
  │    like stdlib logging)
  ▼
logger.handle(record)
  │   logger filters → _freeze_record → manager.enqueue
  ▼
asyncio.Queue (bounded, default 10 000)
  │   overflow policy: "block" | "drop_new" | "drop_old"
  ▼
consumer task ("aiologging-consumer", one per manager)
  │   fan-out: walks the hierarchy while propagate is set
  │   (level checks, lastResort) and enqueues the record on
  │   each eligible handler's dispatch queue
  ▼
per-handler dispatch queues + worker tasks
  │   ("aiologging-handler-<Type>", one per handler, created on
  │   first dispatch) — a slow handler only backs up its own
  │   queue, never the other handlers; ordering is preserved
  │   per handler; handler errors go to stderr and never
  │   interrupt dispatch
  ▼
async handlers (stream / file / rotating / HTTP / Telegram)
```

Key pieces, all in `aiologging/logger.py`:

- **`_freeze_record`** — before queueing, the message is rendered
  eagerly (`record.getMessage()`) and `exc_info` is converted to
  `exc_text`, so later mutation of caller args can't change the
  message and traceback frames aren't kept alive in the queue.
  Mirrors `QueueHandler.prepare`.
- **Delivery modes** (`DeliveryMode`): `"enqueue"` (default) — the
  await resolves once the record is queued; `"await"` — a future is
  attached to the queue item and resolved (via `_RecordCompletion`)
  once the last handler worker finished with the record. Selectable
  per call, per logger, or manager-wide.
- **Overflow policies** (`OverflowPolicy`): `"block"` awaits free
  space, `"drop_new"` discards the incoming record, `"drop_old"`
  discards the oldest queued one. Drops are counted in metrics.
- **Lazy, self-healing consumer** — `_ensure_consumer()` starts the
  task on the first record and rebuilds it when the running event
  loop changes (e.g. one loop per test) or the task died. Records
  stuck in the old queue — including the in-flight one — are rescued
  into `_pending` and redelivered. `_HandlerDispatcher` follows the
  same lifecycle for each handler's queue and worker.
- **Overflow applies per queue** — the policy also governs the
  per-handler dispatch queues (each bounded by `queue_size`), so
  with `"block"` a full dispatch queue suspends the consumer and
  backpressure propagates to the main queue and the producers.
- **Drop policy (opt-in)** — `manager.drop_policy` /
  `basicConfig(drop_policy=LevelAwareDrop(...))` makes overflow
  level-aware, mirroring rsyslog `discardSeverity` and logback
  `discardingThreshold` (both opt-in there too): above the
  `watermark` fill ratio arriving records below `discard_below` are
  shed; on a full queue the oldest expendable queued record is
  evicted to make room (reaching into the queue's deque, with
  `task_done()` keeping `join()` consistent); with no expendable
  victims the configured overflow policy applies unchanged. Applies
  to the main queue and the dispatch queues; any object implementing
  `DropPolicyProtocol` (`is_expendable`,
  `should_discard_arriving`) can replace the level rule.
- **`_IN_CONSUMER` ContextVar** — set inside the consumer task so the
  stdlib bridge can drop records emitted *by handler I/O libraries
  themselves* (e.g. aiohttp logging during an HTTP flush), preventing
  infinite feedback loops.
- **`AsyncLoggerManager`** — owns the hierarchy (`getLogger` with
  dotted names, root at WARNING, eager intermediate loggers), the
  queue and the consumer. The global instance is
  `logger._logger_manager`. `shutdown(timeout=None)` drains the
  queues (bounded by `timeout` when given — on expiry the leftovers
  are dropped and teardown proceeds), cancels the consumer and the
  handler workers, closes every handler and resets the hierarchy to
  a pristine state; `flush(timeout=None)` joins the main queue, then
  every dispatch queue, then calls `force_flush()` on buffered
  handlers (raises `asyncio.TimeoutError` on expiry).
- **`flush_sync(timeout=5.0)`** — synchronous emergency drain for
  contexts without a usable loop (`finally` after `asyncio.run`,
  atexit, sync `main`). Runs `flush()` on a private event loop: the
  consumer, the workers and the handler resources rebuild there via
  the self-healing paths, are suspended again afterwards (records
  and handler state survive for a later loop), and the loop is
  closed. If the manager's loop is alive in another thread the drain
  is submitted to it via `run_coroutine_threadsafe` instead. Called
  from inside a running loop it raises; everything else is reported
  through the `bool` return value, never raised — the caller is
  typically a dying process.
- **Handler loop-affinity** — resources bound to the loop that
  created them heal on loop change: `LazyLock` re-creates its inner
  lock, `AsyncHttpHandlerBase` abandons and re-creates its session
  (externally injected sessions are left untouched), `AsyncFileHandler`
  reopens the file in append mode, `BufferedAsyncHandler` restarts
  its auto-flush task. This is what makes `flush_sync` (and one loop
  per test) deliver through real handlers.
- **atexit drain** — at interpreter exit, undelivered records
  (queued *and* buffered in handlers) are drained via `flush_sync`
  with a 2-second default budget, then a stderr warning reports
  anything left. `set_atexit_flush(0)` / `basicConfig(atexit_flush=0)`
  disables the drain, restoring warn-only behaviour. atexit does not
  run on unhandled signals or `os._exit` — applications must handle
  SIGTERM (e.g. `sys.exit`) for the drain to cover container stops.

## Stdlib bridge (`aiologging/bridge.py`)

`StdlibBridgeHandler` is a *synchronous* `logging.Handler` attached to
the stdlib root by `captureStdlib()`. It forwards third-party records
into the aiologging queue via `manager.enqueue_from_thread`, which is
thread-safe: records from a foreign thread hop into the consumer loop
with `call_soon_threadsafe`; records emitted before any loop exists
are buffered in `_pending` until the consumer starts. Because a sync
producer cannot await, the `"block"` policy degrades to `"drop_new"`
for bridged records: on a full queue the arriving bridged record is
dropped (with accounting) — records already accepted from async
producers are never evicted, so `block` keeps losing nothing for
async callers.

With `captureStdlib(inline_level=logging.ERROR)` the bridge also
delivers critical records **inline**: before queueing, the record is
offered to handlers implementing `emit_sync` (the Telegram handler
POSTs via `urllib` from a helper thread joined with the deadline —
urllib's own timeout does not cover DNS resolution, so a bare call
could block far longer). The inline path is bounded by
`inline_timeout` (default 3 s) and a token bucket (`inline_burst` /
`inline_rate`, default 1 send + 2 per minute); any failure leaves the
record on the normal queue path. A handler that delivered inline is
recorded on the record (`_aiologging_inline_handled`) and its
dispatch worker skips it; other handlers deliver as usual. Guards
against recursion: the `_IN_CONSUMER` check, a thread-local
re-entrancy flag, a marker attribute on inline send threads, and the
bridge overrides `Handler.handle` to run without the stdlib
per-handler lock (holding it across an inline send would deadlock
with code logging from inside the send thread). Inline records reach
their sink ahead of older queued ones — formatters should include
`%(asctime)s`.

                  429 retry_after, token redaction
```

Extension hooks on `AsyncHttpHandlerBase` (added in 0.2.2):

- `_retry_delay_from_response(status, error_text) -> Optional[float]`
  — lets the retry policy see the response. Returning a delay forces
  a retry after that delay even for 4xx (used by Telegram for 429
  with `parameters.retry_after`); returning None keeps the default
  policy (exponential backoff for 5xx, no retry for 4xx).
- `_redacted_url()` — the URL as shown in error messages and repr;
  override when the URL embeds a secret (Telegram hides the bot
  token as `/bot***/`).

## Supporting modules

- `aiologging/types.py` — protocols (`FormatterProtocol`,
  `FilterProtocol`, `AuthenticatorProtocol`), type aliases
  (`HttpBackendType`, `LogLevel`, …) and config containers
  (`BatchConfig`, `HttpConfig`, `FileConfig`, `RotationConfig`,
  `HandlerConfig`, `LoggerConfig`).
- `aiologging/exceptions.py` — hierarchy under `AiologgingError`;
  every exception carries a structured `details` dict plus keyword
  context set as attributes (e.g. `NetworkError(url=…,
  status_code=…)`).
- `aiologging/config.py` — `ConfigManager` builds loggers/handlers
  from dicts, JSON files or env vars; string registry maps `"stream"`,
  `"file"`, `"http"`, `"http_json"`, `"telegram"`, `"rotating_file"`,
  `"timed_rotating_file"` to classes; a `"class"` outside the
  registry is resolved as a dotted path to an `AsyncHandler`
  subclass (stdlib `dictConfig`-style), with remaining config keys
  passed to the constructor as keyword arguments.
- `aiologging/utils.py` — `LazyLock` (an `asyncio.Lock` created on
  first use, because on Python 3.9 `asyncio.Lock()` binds to the
  current loop at construction), `handle_error_with_fallback`,
  `ErrorContext`.
- `aiologging/__init__.py` — public API, `basicConfig`, the
  `create_*_handler` factories, `__version__`.
